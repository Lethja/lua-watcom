These Lua scripts are distributed with Lua for Watcom.
Some are simple demos while others are clones of utilities
that are particularly useful on platforms that have no native equivalent.

Unfortunately, to ensure all scripts can fit on a floppy disk, 
several scripts have been squashed to the point of unintentional obfuscation.
To rectify this, markdown files with the same name will document functions and
variables.

The scripts are split into the following folders:

| Folder Name    | Description                                                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [core](./core) | Scripts that go in all distribution, namely included in the 160K floppy disk image    |
| [xtra](./xtra) | Extra scripts that are omitted from the 160K floppy disk image duo to space constants |
